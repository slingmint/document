after running script, had to do two things to get this thing to work:


1. edit the following files: (from http://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=8316)

xrdp.service file
The xrdp.service file should contain the following information.  copy/paste the text below into the /lib/systemd/system/xrdp.service file and save it.  You need to use sudo command in order to be able to modify this file.((i.e. sudo gedit /lib/systemd/system/xrdp.service)

[Unit]
Description=xrdp daemon
Requires=xrdp-sesman.service
After=syslog.target network.target xrdp-sesman.service

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/xrdp.pid
#EnvironmentFile=/etc/sysconfig/xrdp
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/xrdp $XRDP_OPTIONS
ExecStop=/usr/local/sbin/xrdp $XRDP_OPTIONS –kill

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

 
xrdp-sesman.service file
The xrdp-sesman.service file should look like the one below.  Copy/paste the text below into the /lib/systemd/system/xrdp-sesman.service file and save it.  You need to use sudo command in order to be able to modify this file. (i.e. sudo gedit /lib/systemd/system/xrdp-sesman.service)

[Unit]
Description=xrdp session manager
After=syslog.target network.target
StopWhenUnneeded=true

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/xrdp-sesman.pid
#EnvironmentFile=/etc/sysconfig/xrdp
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman $SESMAN_OPTIONS
ExecStop=/usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman $SESMAN_OPTIONS –kill

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
 

Using systemctl to apply changes
The final step here is to issue the following command because we have modified the service units files of XRDP.  Systemd needs to know about these changes.  From a Terminal session, you will issue the following command

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl enable xrdp.service
 

Reboot your system and check that the xrdp service is starting properly.  If this is the case, you should be able to perform an xrdp connection and you are back on track.





-----------------------------------
2. for MATE desktop (which I'm using), need to add an .xsession file in the HOME directory (per http://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=5382):

echo mate-session> ~/.xsession

and then restart the xrdp service by issuing the following commandsudo service xrdp restart
